# Repository Structure
- bin
    - compiled program files
- examples
    - text files used for tests
- langs
    - text files in different languages from https://sourceforge.net/projects/la-strings/files/Language-Data/
- report
    - report and documentation of assignment
- src
    - files related to the developed code (lang, findlang and locatelang)
## How to run lang program
Change to src folder
```
cd src/
```

Compile
```
g++ -std=c++11 lang.cpp -o lang
```

Just run the executable file with the parameters
```
./lang <reference_filename> <target_filename> <k> <alpha> <fail_threshold>
```

## How to run findlang program
Change to src folder
```
cd src/
```

Compile
```
g++ -std=c++11 findlang.cpp -o findlang
```

Just run the executable file with the parameters
```
./findlang <reference_files_directory> <target_filename> <k> <alpha> <fail_threshold>
```

## How to run locatelang program
Change to src folder
```
cd src/
```

Compile
```
g++ -std=c++11 locatelang.cpp -o locatelang
```

Just run the executable file with the parameters. Model type should be -c (copy model) or -f (finite context model). The segment length is the size of the subsequence to be considered inside of the target text.
```
./locatelang <model_type> <reference_files_directory> <target_filename> <segment_length> <k> <alpha> <fail_threshold>
```

## Example for lang
Run the lang program with the portuguese text in langs folder (pt_PT.Portugese-latn-EP7.utf8) as reference and  the maias.txt file in examples folder as target text. First it is necessary to change to src/ folder
```
cd src/
```

After that, you should compile the lang program code
```
g++ -std=c++11 lang.cpp -o lang
```

Finally, just run the executable with the reference and target filenames, k, alpha and threshold. In this case was used a k=3, alpha=1 and threshold=3
```
./lang ../langs/pt_PT.Portugese-latn-EP7.utf8 ../examples/maias.txt 3 1 3
```

This should be printed in the terminal
```
Hits: 389255
Fails: 812099
Estimated total bits: 2.72992e+06
Average bits per symbol: 2.08557
```

## Example for findlang
First it is necessary to change to src/ folder
```
cd src/
```

After that, you should compile the findlang program code
```
g++ -std=c++11 findlang.cpp -o findlang
```

Finally, just run the executable passing the langs folder (wich contain several texts in distinct languages), the target text(text to be analyzed), k (sequence size), alpha and the fails threshold.. In this case was used a text in portuguese (national anthem), a k=3, alpha=1 and threshold=3
```
./findlang ../langs/ ../examples/hino.txt 3 1 3
```

This should be printed in the terminal

```

## Example for locatelang
First it is necessary to change to src/ folder
```
cd src/
```

After that, you should compile the lang program code
```
g++ -std=c++11 locatelang.cpp -o locatelang
```

Finally, just run the executable with the model type (in this case was used the copy model, -c), reference and target filenames (locatelang.txt), k, alpha and threshold. In this case was used a segment_length=50, k=5, alpha=1 and threshold=3
```
./locatelang -c ../langs/ ../examples/locatelang.txt 60 5 1 3
```

This should be printed in the terminal
```
Segment: 0-107 is likely in pt_PT.Portugese-latn-EP7.utf8 with estimated bits: 12049
Segment: 107-212 is likely in tr_TR.Turkish-latn-wiki.utf8 with estimated bits: 9795
